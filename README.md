## Introduction

In this project, we aim to apply the knowledge gained from the Data Analytics modules of our MBA course to solve a real-world business problem. By analyzing the dataset, we seek to uncover insights that can guide marketing strategies and lead to more effective client engagement and subscription rates.

## Project Definition and Problem Statement

Our project's focus is on optimizing the bank's marketing campaigns, particularly its term deposit subscriptions. We aim to identify key factors influencing subscription decisions and provide actionable recommendations to enhance marketing efforts.

## Data Source and Description

The dataset contains information about client attributes, marketing campaigns, and outcomes. It serves as the foundation for our analysis, allowing us to explore trends, patterns, and correlations to inform our insights.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During our EDA phase, we delve into the dataset to understand its characteristics. Visualizations and statistical analyses help us uncover relationships between variables and prepare us for hypothesis testing.

## Hypotheses and Business Questions

We've formulated several hypotheses and business questions:
1. Does age influence the likelihood of a term deposit subscription?
2. Are certain education levels associated with higher subscription rates?
3. How do the outcomes of previous marketing campaigns impact the success of the current campaign?

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

We analyze key performance indicators to guide our analysis:
- Subscription Rate
- Conversion Rate
- Campaign Effectiveness
- Age Distribution
- Education-Based Subscription
